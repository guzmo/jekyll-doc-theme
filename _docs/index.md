Oopsie exists to make it easy for you to create your ideas! Doesn't matter if you are gonna create a small application or if you want to push Big Data for later analyze, we  supply it for you!

Do you really need:
 - To code huge and complex backends? 
 - A huge operation department to handle your server and scale with your business? 
 - To get stuck in an architecture where you can't scale because your backend is not made for it?

 **NO, and why should you!**

 In this homepage you will ( hopefully ) find everything you need to know to create and deploy sites with Oopsie. If anything is missing, please contact us or give us a pull-request to this documentations repository, that is created with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
