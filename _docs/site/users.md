Oopsie can help you handle users for your site. You can register, login and logout users via Oopsie, or you can disable this feature all together if you don't want to handle Users.

> If you are not creating a homepage and want to register your Users with help of Oopsie you might rather want to look at [Api keys](/docs/api-keys) to protect your data.
