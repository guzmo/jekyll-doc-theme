You can use Api keys to protect your data if you have any sensitive data.
For eg. maybe you want some to give away an API Key that only has READ or WRITE access to a specific Resource, or a couple of Resources.

>**Always be carefull with your Api keys, if you think one is compromised, revoke it immediatelly!**
